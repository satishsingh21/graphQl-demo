### GraphQL is a declarative, strongly-typed query language for client applications. Clients define the exact data shape and contents that they need in a single request which eliminates over-fetching problems and circumvents the need for multiple costly round trips to the server. It has one single endpoint for all kinds of requests, and the method has to be a post request.

### GraphQL is a query language for your API - not databases, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data.

### As we know, a REST API typically delivers all the data a client UI might need about a resource and leaves it up to the client to extract the bits of data it actually wants to show. If that data is not a resource it already has, then the client needs to go off to the server and request some more data from another URL. Over time, the link between front-end applications and back-end servers can become pretty rigid. As data gets more complex in structure, it gets harder and slower to query with traditional tools.

### GraphQL does not mandate the use of a particular language â€“ JAVA, Ruby and many others have implementations. GraphQL itself is independent of language
